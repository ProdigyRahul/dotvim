# 30-day plan (5-10 hours/day)

If you do ~2-4 hours/day, stretch this to 6-8 weeks. The order matters.

## Rules (do these every day)

1. Warm-up (15 minutes):
   - `f`/`t` + `;`/`,` on a code line
   - 10 text object edits (`ci"` `ci)` `ci{` `dip` `dap`)
   - 10 repeats with `.`
2. Learn (60-120 minutes): read today's chapter and do drills.
3. Apply (60-180 minutes): do a real-code mission using only today's tools.
4. Review (10 minutes): write down 3 things that felt slow.

## Week 1: Core grammar + editing accuracy

Day 1: `01-mindset-and-modes.md`
Day 2: `02-motions.md` (within-line + structural)
Day 3: `03-operators-and-text-objects.md` (built-in objects)
Day 4: `03-operators-and-text-objects.md` (treesitter objects: functions/classes/params)
Day 5: `04-repeat-and-edit-speed.md` (`.` / `g;` / change list)
Day 6: `05-visual-mode.md` (especially `<C-v>` block edits)
Day 7: Review day
  - do capstone drills from chapters 1-5 in one session

## Week 2: Search, replace, and Ex power

Day 8: `06-search.md`
Day 9: `07-substitute-and-regex.md` (basics + confirmations)
Day 10: `07-substitute-and-regex.md` (advanced patterns + `:g`)
Day 11: `08-command-line-and-ranges.md` (`q:` / ranges / `:normal`)
Day 12: Review day (project-wide rename/refactor without multi-cursor)
Day 13: `09-registers.md`
Day 14: Review day (registers + search + substitute)

## Week 3: Macros, navigation memory, and workflow

Day 15: `10-macros.md` (record/play/repeat)
Day 16: `10-macros.md` (macro editing + applying with `:normal`)
Day 17: `11-marks-jumps-and-lists.md` (marks/jumplist/changelist)
Day 18: `12-windows-quickfix-and-locationlist.md`
Day 19: `13-lsp-and-code-navigation.md` (your LSP + TS workflow)
Day 20: `14-telescope-flash-and-filetools.md` (your project navigation)
Day 21: Review day (do a real bugfix end-to-end)

## Week 4: Git, refactors, and "hard mode" mastery

Day 22: `15-git-workflows.md` (gitsigns + fugitive + lazygit)
Day 23: `16-spectre-and-multi-file-refactors.md`
Day 24: `17-terminal-and-automation.md` (toggleterm + sending selections)
Day 25: `18-customization-and-debugging.md` (learn to debug your own config)
Day 26: Capstone prep (pick a real refactor)
Day 27: `19-capstone.md` (part 1)
Day 28: `19-capstone.md` (part 2)
Day 29: Weakness day (redo the chapters you struggle with)
Day 30: Final capstone + make your own cheatsheet from memory

## Metrics (how you know you're improving)

- You can describe edits as "operator + text object/motion" before doing them.
- You use `.` instead of repeating manual edits.
- You can do a multi-file rename without multi-cursor.
- You can record a macro and apply it correctly on the first try.
- You can explain *why* a command works, not just "it does something".
